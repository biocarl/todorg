# tudOrg - a todo app based on org-mode.

This is still a very early sketch.

## Goal
Built a minimalist, clean todo app which is a hybrid of `capture` (for org-mode) and Google Keep.

## Milestones
- [ ] Title with description
- [ ] Support hierarchies, nested bullets
- [ ] Much more

##  Supported subset of the org-mode specification
- Bullets (one hierarchy) with multiline text
- States: TODO and DONE
